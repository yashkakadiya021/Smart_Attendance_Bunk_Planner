<h1>🎓 Smart Attendance Bunk Planner</h1>

<p>
A beginner-friendly project that helps students calculate how many more classes they can skip without dropping below the required attendance limit. <br><br>
This tool is designed especially for <strong>machine learning and Python beginners</strong> who want to build something useful and smart — even without using advanced AI models. It's an excellent way to start thinking like a data-driven developer!

<h2>🧠 What Kind of Machine Learning is Used?</h2>
<p>
This project does <strong>not use advanced machine learning models</strong> like classification or deep learning — and that’s intentional.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it uses a concept inspired by <strong>rule-based systems</strong> and <strong>predictive logic</strong>, which are foundational steps in ML thinking.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📊 It simulates future outcomes based on user input (like a predictive model).</li>
  <li>🧮 It applies logic-based thresholds (just like classification boundaries in ML).</li>
  <li>📈 It helps you understand how small input changes affect output — the basis of data-driven decision-making.</li>
</ul>
